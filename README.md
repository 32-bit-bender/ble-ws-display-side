# BLE Weather Station - Weather Display Side
This repository is part of my BLE Weather Station Project. The goal is to master BLE on the ESP32 architecture and familiarize myself with the ESP-IDF framework based on FreeRTOS. The display server will periodically receive data from the BLE weather server and show it on a touch LCD.
