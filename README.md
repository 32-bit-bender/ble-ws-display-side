# BLE Weather Station - Weather Display Side
This repository is part of my BLE Weather Station Project. The goal of this project is to learn BLE on the ESP32 architecture and to become familiar with the ESP-IDF framework based on FreeRTOS. The display server will receive data priodically from the BLE weather server and display it on a touch LCD.
